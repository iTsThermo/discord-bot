Discort Bot w/ ChatGPT integrated

Steps to get this bot up and running:
 1. Get your own bot through the discord API website and add it to your server-> Get API
 2. Get Open AI API
 3. Create .env file in the directory of the project
    it should look like the following:
    DISCORD_TOKEN=discord_API
    CHATGPT_TOKEN=Open_AI_API
 4. Use '.' before your requests so the bot detects and knows you are talking to it
    example:
        .What city in NY is the captol?
